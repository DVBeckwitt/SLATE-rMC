# Contracts

Contract API version: **10**. Trace schema version: **4**. Reference pack version: **1**.

Production contracts are frozen dataclasses or immutable model objects. Numeric arrays are copied to
contiguous, read-only storage at public boundaries. Shapes, units, frames, measure IDs, validity,
and ordering are validated eagerly.

## Global conventions

- Column vectors and active rotations.
- Radians internally.
- Metres for instrument positions; angstroms for wavelength and crystal lengths; inverse angstroms
  for wavevectors.
- Array access is `[row, column]`; continuous detector coordinates are `(column_px, row_px)`.
- `Q = kf - ki` in the declared frame.
- Invalid rows have explicit status and cannot carry fabricated nonzero intensity.
- IDs prove alignment and provenance; they are not numerical weights or sorting keys.

## Stable core data contracts

| Contract | Owner | Essential payload |
|---|---|---|
| `SourceConfiguration` / `sample_gaussian_source_rays` | configured pipeline / sampling | validated source parameters and immutable sampled source rows |
| `IncidentSampleBatch` | sampling | complete source rows, empirical weights, wavelength, polarization, provenance |
| `InstrumentConfiguration` / `CompiledInstrument` | geometry | canonical transforms, sample support, detector shape/pitch/reference coordinate, revisions |
| `IncidentStateBatch` | geometry | entrance-intersected air and film-phase `ki`, Fresnel amplitude, decay, footprint, source identity |
| `MaterialOptics` | materials | wavelength-aligned complex refractive index and material revision |
| `RodCatalog` | reciprocal | every physical `(h,k)` rod and exact family metadata |
| `RodQueryBatch` | ordered/stacking | rod-aligned `L` queries with stable IDs |
| `EventIntensityResult` | ordered/stacking | query-aligned amplitude, intensity, normalization, and model revision |
| `ParrattResult` / `SpecularResult` | reflectivity | separately named Parratt, kinematic, and composite specular outputs |
| `MeasuredPeakDiscovery` / `MeasuredIndexingResult` | selection | hashed image/mask/calibration provenance, native coordinates, reciprocal labels, decisions, and replicated branch tracks |

`axis_rotation_transform(rotation)` is the authoritative conversion of one `AxisRotation` into an
active LAB-to-LAB rigid transform about its declared LAB pivot. `compile_instrument` uses the same
function for every commanded goniometer motion in tuple order.

`EventIntensityResult` retains “event” in its historical type name, but it is an ordered query result;
it is not a sampled scattering-event runtime. Its strength excludes source probability, rod
population, mosaic probability, optics, polarization, detector Jacobians, and pixel integration.

## Continuous reciprocal contracts

### `MosaicParameters`

Owns Gaussian sigma, Lorentzian HWHM, mixture probability, and deterministic proof quadrature. A
zero width is permitted only for an inactive mixture component. The accepted continuous law is
folded alpha/full beta and integrates to one.

### `Rod`

Owns exact `(h,k)`, family metadata, and population. Rod identity is never a floating radial value.

### `MosaicBraggSpace`

- `map_latent(rod, alpha_rad, beta_rad, u_Ainv)` maps arbitrary broadcast coordinates to sample-frame
  `Q`.
- `evaluate_latent(...)` returns per-rod mosaic density, finite-stack strength, and their product.
- `rod_u_bounds_Ainv(rod)` returns the full elastic-reach axial interval.

The map and density are functions; a quadrature node set is never the model.

### `ContinuousEwaldCoating`

- `evaluate_geometry(rod, branch, alpha_rad, beta_rad)` returns only the analytic Ewald geometry for
  a non-specular rod/root and evaluates no mosaic or structure-factor intensity.
- `evaluate_latent(rod, branch, alpha_rad, beta_rad)` solves the analytic elastic root and returns
  geometry, strength, mosaic density, and the once-only Ewald coarea-weighted coating.
- `evaluate_specular_geometry(...)` exposes retained nonzero branch-0 `m=0` geometry without
  inventing finite direct-beam intensity. The algebraic `Q=0` direct root is suppressed. The
  separate detector-visible all-roots path may include regular nonzero `m=0` support only with a
  positive reciprocal-gap certificate.

## Detector contracts

### `DetectorEwaldMeasure`

Immutable one-incident-state model. It requires the canonical transported film-phase `ki`, matching
air wavelength, strict root classification, material optics, and compiled instrument.

- `evaluate_detector_geometry(column_px, row_px, *, include_surface_jacobian=True)` performs detector
  point → outgoing ray → exit refraction → film `kf` → sample-frame `Q` and reports
  validity and elastic residual. The ray is valid only on the active front face,
  `n_D dot kf_hat > 1e-14`; back-side and tangent approaches are rejected before optical or
  reciprocal work. Passing `False` skips derivative work and returns a zero Jacobian when only ray
  validity or `Q` is needed.
- `evaluate_detector_coordinates(column_px, row_px, rods, branch)` returns the almost-everywhere
  `raw_detector_coordinate_density_A2_per_px2.v1`, per-rod contributions, inverse-branch counts, and
  caustic flags.
- `map_latent(...)` is the independent forward route used for proof and diagnostics.
- `map_latent_geometry(...)` is the same canonical forward geometry, exit refraction, and detector
  intersection without mosaic, structure strength, attenuation, or intensity work.
- `integrate_native_pixels(...)` returns deterministic `raw_detector_pixel_mass_A2.v1` with
  convergence, work-count, validity, and per-rod evidence.

### `SourceAveragedDetectorEwaldMeasure`

Owns an ordered tuple of complete incident-state measures. Its arbitrary-coordinate evaluator sums
independent source intensities over all retained roots. Detector-visible `m=0` is admitted only when
every contributing top-exit state proves the positive direct-root gap. Its quantitative native-pixel
integrator is deliberately branch-specific and rejects any model containing `m=0`; the configured
all-root macrobin path is an explicitly nonquantitative display preview. Source state order and
weights are preserved; wavelength-dependent evaluators are never collapsed geometrically.

The source-averaged `integrate_native_pixels(...)` method is a detailed per-rod proof path, not a
production renderer. It fails closed unless the caller explicitly passes
`include_per_rod_evidence=True`. The detailed arbitrary-coordinate evaluator remains available
without that flag because it performs no pixel integration.

### `ContinuousNormalizedAngleFunction`

Owns one pose-bound `ContinuousDetectorFunction` and one fixed `AngleFrame`. Callers provide only
broadcastable `two_theta_rad` and `phi_rad`; the wrapper obtains the corrected
`CompiledInstrument` from the detector function, so a stale or mismatched detector pose cannot be
supplied separately. `phi` is canonicalized into `[-pi, pi)`.

The immutable `ContinuousNormalizedAngleValues` payload retains the inverse detector coordinates,
the detector-area Jacobian `N`, angular signal density `S`, normalized detector density `I=S/N`,
caustic flags, and pointwise validity. It applies no detector solid-angle acceptance correction.
The exact pole and every invalid/off-panel direction have `S=N=I=0`. Finite bins are a separate
consumer and must integrate `S` and `N` before division.

### Configured simulation

- `load_simulation_config(path, repository_root=...)` accepts one strict
  `rasim-simulation-v2` YAML document. Unknown, duplicate, aliased, or missing fields fail.
- `build_configured_simulation_inputs(config)` creates source rows, canonical incident states,
  material, rods, finite-2H strength, and Bragg space once.
- `sample_configured_source(source, sample_count=...)` is the one mapping from validated configured
  source parameters to the canonical source sampler, including the exact one-row nominal state.
- `build_source_averaged_detector(inputs)` builds the all-state detector model.
- `evaluate_detector_density_all_roots(column_px, row_px, ...)` returns one continuous-coordinate
  density after every source state, physical rod, and retained inverse root has been reduced. Its
  coordinate-shaped caustic flag is the logical OR of the detailed rod flags. The existing
  per-rod coordinate evaluator remains the proof and diagnostic interface.
- `evaluate_nominal_integer_l_markers(context)` solves exact integer-L intersections on the
  peak-mosaic (`alpha=0`) manifold, applies the canonical nominal-state exit/refraction and active
  detector visibility path, and retains every physical rod before grouping only coincident display
  labels. The seam-safe `root_sign = sign(sin(beta - phase))` distinguishes the analytic
  `phase-delta` and `phase+delta` sites even when `(m,L,branch)` labels coincide. These are
  `peak_mosaic_alpha0_integer_L_center.v2` nominal-source references, not source-averaged raster
  maxima.
- `sample_reciprocal_space`, `evaluate_nominal_ewald_surface`, and
  `integrate_detector_macrobins` generate optional display data without becoming model authority.
  Macrobin integration consumes only the completed total coordinate density; its result has no
  per-rod pixel axis.

## Measured selection and indexing

`discover_measured_cake_peaks(...)` accepts a detector-native image, mask, `CompiledInstrument`,
`AngleFrame`, and immutable policy. It builds a tiled angle chart without accepting a marker
catalogue or predicted marker coordinates, then refines each proposal once on the native raster.
Image, mask, calibration, and policy identities are retained in `MeasuredPeakDiscovery`.

`index_discovered_integer_l_peaks(...)` converts only discovered native coordinates to sample-frame
`Q`, infers family `m`, integer `L`, analytic Ewald branch, and beta-root sign through the canonical
geometry/root authorities, and deterministically drops tangent, conflicting, noncoincident, or
ambiguously owned labels. Exact alpha-zero anchors are generated only after the discrete label is
frozen. `select_confident_branch_tracks(...)`
requires distinct-incidence replication with shared `L` identities and returns an immutable hashed
`MeasuredIndexingResult`. Non-detection is never treated as a physical extinction, and fitting may
not change an identity inside an optimization.

## Exact integer-L tagged detector-function fitting

`ContinuousDetectorGeometryModel.bind(...)` returns an immutable callable detector field
`D(column_px,row_px)`. Reference and trial fields remain functions; fitting does not rasterize,
pixel-integrate, or evaluate a detector-domain quadrature. Exact tags are associated landmarks on
each field's continuous detector-coordinate domain. They are not scalar-density maxima or
intensity centroids.

All tags use exactly one deterministic incident companion state with source-center origin, zero
divergence, and mean wavelength (`nominal_source_center.zero_divergence.mean_wavelength.v1`). The
Monte Carlo source index is not part of tag identity, so a 1,000-state detector field still has
one tag per visible user-facing `(m,L,tag_branch)`. The companion state traverses the same
incident transport, Ewald, exit-refraction, and detector-intersection code, but is not inserted as
an artificial finite-mass delta into the empirical Gaussian source sum.

For nonzero `m`, `IntegerLMarkerKey` freezes `(m, L, Ewald branch, beta-root sign,
representative physical rod)` and the nominal-source `alpha=0` policy. The two `root_sign` values
are the two analytic beta-root sides; they are not two Ewald branches. User-facing `tag_branch=1`
is `root_sign=-1`, and `tag_branch=2` is `root_sign=+1`; the analytic Ewald branch remains separate
provenance. Exactly one tag is allowed for each `(m,L,tag_branch)`. Missing, tangent, or
branch-changing roots fail instead of being reassigned. For `m=0`, exact `L` alone leaves a
continuous orientation curve, so the only admitted landmark policy selects the unique exact-L
reciprocal-axis direction with minimum mosaic tilt relative to the unmosaicked axis. This is a
geometry landmark, not a claimed m=0 intensity peak; its user-facing branch is `tag_branch=0`.

An exact landmark may lie on an integrable caustic of the zero-transverse-width detector density.
The tagged-coordinate observable is still well defined there, but its pointwise scalar intensity
is not used as a residual. Pixel mass would require the separate native-pixel integration API and
is deliberately outside this fit.

`fit_tagged_detector_function_geometry(...)` evaluates reference tags from one bound callable and
trial tags from the same prepared detector-function family. It simultaneously minimizes
covariance-whitened exact-tag coordinate residuals, fixed-span half-angle residuals between each
nonzero-m root-side pair, and the total-least-squares m=0 exact-L line angle. There is no centroid
term. `evaluate_tagged_geometry_objective_residual(...)` exposes the same immutable whitened
site-plus-line vector for scientific diagnostics and error injection.
Its ordering is nonzero coordinate pairs, sorted paired-branch half-angle terms, m=0 coordinate
pairs, then the m=0 TLS-line half-angle term; m=0 L identities and wavelength must match exactly.
The fitter uses bounded TRF least squares. The accepted single-5-degree parameterization
`detector_xy_plus_pivoted_effective_sample_normal_xy.v2` applies active intrinsic local-x then
current-local-y rotations relative to the frozen base poses:

```text
R_detector = R_detector,0 Rx(delta_detector,column) Ry(delta_detector,row)
R_sample   = R_sample,0   Rx(delta_sample-normal,x) Ry(delta_sample-normal,y)
```

Detector corrections keep the declared detector reference point fixed. Sample corrections use one
fixed mechanical LAB pivot `p`. With `A = R_sample R_sample,0^T`, the sample origin changes as

```text
t_sample = p + A (t_sample,0 - p).
```

The model infers `p` only when every configured goniometer axis declares the same pivot. A
configuration with no axis or unequal pivots must supply an explicit
`sample_correction_pivot_lab_m`; it never silently substitutes the sample origin or one arbitrary
axis pivot.

Every trial tag rebuilds canonical incident transport, solves the exact Ewald constraint, applies
exit refraction, and intersects the corrected detector plane. No reciprocal-space point is
geometrically projected onto an image surrogate.

TRF accepts steps by decrease of the complete coordinate-plus-angle least-squares objective. It
does not require every individual line angle to decrease at every accepted step. The angle-only
Jacobian has rank two for this four-parameter fixture, and different tagged lines can request
conflicting local directions; an angle-monotone projection would therefore discard identifiable
coordinate information or stall. Exact coordinates provide the missing directions, while the
reported chord and m=0 angles verify the shared line geometry at the solution.

The detector limits use RA-SIM's direct `(+/-10 deg, +/-10 deg)` pitch/yaw hard shells. The two
effective sample-normal components conservatively use its `+/-5 deg` angular-correction shell;
RA-SIM has no separately bounded second reduced-normal coordinate. They share the declared fixed
pivot but are not separately recovered sample-mount and named goniometer-axis errors. A preflight
bound-scaled Jacobian must have rank four and acceptable condition.
`audit_integer_l_marker_selection(...)` independently re-enumerates the full visible
non-specular catalog after fitting and reports `SAME`, `MISSING`, `CHANGED`, or `AMBIGUOUS` without
reassignment.

One image at one commanded goniometer angle cannot distinguish raw sample-zero tilt, goniometer-axis
yaw/pitch, crystal rotation about the rod axis, detector tangent translation/beam-center shifts, or
sample-normal offset/detector-distance gauges. Those parameters require additional constrained data,
especially multiple commanded goniometer angles; they are not exposed by this fit contract.

## Once-only factor ownership

| Factor | Owner |
|---|---|
| empirical source mass | source sampler |
| sample-footprint acceptance and entrance amplitude | incident transport |
| per-rod population | `MosaicBraggSpace` |
| CIF/finite-stack structure strength | ordered strength model |
| wrapped mosaic probability | `MosaicBraggSpace` |
| Ewald restriction / inverse-map determinant | Ewald or detector pushforward, by declared route |
| exit amplitude and uniform-depth attenuation | detector optical mapping |
| phase and polarization weights | detector measure construction |
| source-state sum | source-averaged detector measure |
| detector box integration | pixel integrator |

The two Ewald routes are equivalent proof views and are never multiplied together.

## Removed API

Contract version 9 intentionally has no compatibility shims for sampled mosaic orientation batches,
candidate selection, scattering-event batches, outgoing-wave batches, detector-hit batches, event
transport, point deposition, discrete Ewald painters, sphere textures, or raster grids. Callers must
use the continuous reciprocal and detector contracts above.
