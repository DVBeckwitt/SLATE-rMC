# Interactive tools

This directory contains every active, user-driven visualization entry point in the repository.
Batch simulations and proof utilities remain in `scripts/`; the immutable original-RA-SIM snapshot
under `reference/` is reference material rather than a supported application.

Install the visualization dependencies from the repository root:

```powershell
uv sync --frozen --group dev --extra visualization
```

## Monte Carlo detector viewer

Render the complete native detector while changing source, mosaic, sample, and detector parameters:

```powershell
uv run --extra visualization python interactive/detector_viewer.py `
  --execution-backend cuda `
  --presentation-backend opengl
```

The viewer coalesces slider input at 5 ms, preserves the full detector grid, and progressively
refines draw prefixes before publishing the requested settled result. CUDA/OpenGL are explicit;
use `--execution-backend cpu --presentation-backend matplotlib` for the software path. Press `R`
to render, `0` to reset, or `Q` to close. See `docs/EXAMPLES.md` for the scientific measure and the
complete control semantics.

## Bi2Se3/Bi2Te3 Ewald viewer

Open synchronized Ewald spheres and detector planes for Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 at 5, 10, and 15 degrees:

```powershell
uv run --extra visualization python interactive/ewald_sphere_viewer.py `
  --mode intensity `
  --stride 2
```

Dragging focuses a lightweight preview of the selected panel; releasing synchronizes all six
panels. Use the radio buttons or `I`/`C` to switch between intensity and cylinder sections, and
`X`, `Y`, or `Z` for axis-aligned views. Press `R` to reset or `Q` to close.
