# Interactive tools

This directory contains every active, user-driven visualization entry point in the repository.
Batch simulations and proof utilities remain in `scripts/`; the immutable original-RA-SIM snapshot
under `reference/` is reference material rather than a supported application.

Install the visualization dependencies from the repository root:

```powershell
uv sync --frozen --group dev --extra visualization
```

## Monte Carlo detector viewer

On Windows, run `uv sync --frozen --extra visualization` once from the repository root,
then double-click `Launch Bi2Se3.cmd` there. You can create a desktop shortcut to that file;
the launcher finds the repository regardless of the shortcut's working directory.
It uses the repository's `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` and explicitly selects CPU/Matplotlib,
which avoids requiring CUDA or Qt for this launch. Errors remain visible until a key is pressed;
a normal close exits immediately. The launcher does not install dependencies.

Arguments pass through to the viewer and override the launcher's backend choices:

```powershell
& '.\Launch Bi2Se3.cmd' --help
& '.\Launch Bi2Se3.cmd' --execution-backend cpu --presentation-backend matplotlib
& '.\Launch Bi2Se3.cmd' --execution-backend cuda --presentation-backend opengl
```

You can append the same arguments after the quoted launcher path in a shortcut's Target field.
The viewer's own defaults remain CUDA/OpenGL. To invoke them directly, render the complete
native detector while changing source, mosaic, sample, and detector parameters:

```powershell
uv run --extra visualization python interactive/detector_viewer.py `
  --execution-backend cuda `
  --presentation-backend opengl
```

The viewer coalesces slider input at 5 ms, preserves the full detector grid, and progressively
refines draw prefixes before publishing the requested settled result. CUDA/OpenGL are explicit;
use `--execution-backend cpu --presentation-backend matplotlib` for the software path. Press `R`
to render, `0` to reset, or `Q` to close. See `docs/EXAMPLES.md` for the scientific measure and the
complete control semantics.

Beam positions now use a smooth Gaussian profile by default (`--beam-position smooth`). Each
scattering contribution projects and integrates its conditional beam profile into native pixels;
Monte Carlo samples divergence, wavelength and mosaic. Position/divergence correlations are
preserved. The qualitative starting budget is 128 source states and 8 mosaic draws per state;
increase `--source-samples` and `--draws-per-ki` or their sliders for refinement.

Smooth profiles require an unbounded planar sample and no external-path absorption. For other
configurations, or for the previous point-sampling method, use `--beam-position sampled`.
The former sampling budget is `--source-samples 1000 --draws-per-ki 49`. Smooth mode retains
off-panel contributions and lets beam intensity leave the panel without renormalization. A
six-standard-deviation integration cutoff omits at most approximately 6e-9 of each Gaussian's
mass, in addition to numerical quadrature error. This is a qualitative preview, not a fitted or
converged result.

## Bi2Se3/Bi2Te3 Ewald viewer

Open synchronized Ewald spheres and detector planes for Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 at 5, 10, and 15 degrees:

```powershell
uv run --extra visualization python interactive/ewald_sphere_viewer.py `
  --mode intensity `
  --stride 2
```

Dragging focuses a lightweight preview of the selected panel; releasing synchronizes all six
panels. Use the radio buttons or `I`/`C` to switch between intensity and cylinder sections, and
`X`, `Y`, or `Z` for axis-aligned views. Press `R` to reset or `Q` to close.
